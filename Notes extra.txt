MiFID brokers  can opt into the SI regime from 03 January 2018.
Getting back to you re the Systematic Internalizer question, here is some feedback I have received previously from our London team:

The SI designation does not apply to the Futures & Clearing business directly.  In relation to other product areas, following is what I have gathered:

The MIFID II SI regime kicks off in September 2018 based on decisions made by regulators. We might opt in voluntarily before in some products, however this is not something which is formally decided yet and which we communicate about publicly due to the sensitivity of this information.  We were an SI in Equity for MiFID I and we will continue to be.   Outside of equities the determination has yet to be made.   Citi will be reaching out to clients to notify if and when Citi makes a determinations that for a specific product/legal entity it will be an SI.   These elections are possible at any point from Jan-2018:

- this is just a notification to the regulators
- all our EEA legal entities (CGML, CGMD, CBNA LDN, CEP) could potentially be an SI in some products 
- either mandatorily from Sep 2018 or by opting-in between Jan and Sep 2018 we could become an SI in any of our products



exotic product allotment:
Dispersion - Cap/Floor - Volatility Swaps
Barrier Option
Gamma Swap
Option on Return Dispersion
Correlation Swap - Conditional 
Option on Spread
Variance Swap – Conditional Outperf
Variance Swap – Gamma Weighted 
Volatility Swap - Conditional
Volatility Swap - Conditional Ref Index



We clear CDS trades via ICE clear Credit 
IRS’s which can clear go through LCH
Citi clearing receives our trades via Markit.


the simple difference between KI Var swaps Vs Vanilla Var swaps is that KI will have a trigger point, once hit only then will become active prior to that point being reached they are ‘inactive’

Agreed with you Ben, there seems to be no other options for the knock in side of things, bare as a rates section. 



As per our call earlier I’ve listed below the instructions for accessing the ESMA reference data list (FIRDS), see p6 onward. We would potentially need access to this list for reconciliation purposes.

Ok I’m now the one with the bad news, I was just talking with Adrien and he gave me the below example, this looks like an interest rate future dual listed on CME, ICE and Singapore.

If so this blows all our futures understanding out the water. I assume ESMA will still publish the ISIN on FIRDS, however would the CME also assign the ISIN to their listing of this instrument? 



Chaps, further to our call I checked and corporate actions where we face the broker we can still report the broker as the buyer or seller. If we faced the issuer directly, which I don’t think we do, we would have to report the issuer. So hopefully that puts that issue to bed. P39 onward has details of the corporate actions:

However, I just read the following which creates another new issue:
